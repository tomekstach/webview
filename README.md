# Connexions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Connexions/webview.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Connexions/webview) [![dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Connexions/webview.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Connexions/webview#info=dependencies) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Connexions/webview/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Connexions/webview#info=devDependencies)

Below are instructions for hosting and building the site and a layout of how the code is organized.

CNX webview is designed to be run as a frontend for [cnx-archive](https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-archive).

# Installing

1. If necessary, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and npm (included with Node.js).
1. Run `npm install --global n` to install the [node version manager](npmjs.com/package/n)
2. Run `./script/bootstrap` in the command line to install all the package dependencies.
  * **Note:** `npm install` runs `bower install` and `grunt install`, both of which can also be run independently
    * `bower install` downloads front-end dependencies
    * `grunt install` compiles the Aloha-Editor (which is downloaded by bower)

By default, webview will use [cnx-archive](https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-archive) and [cnx-authoring](https://github.com/Connexions/cnx-authoring) hosted on cnx.org.


# Building

From the root `webview` directory, run `./script/setup`.

The `dist` directory containing the built site will be added to the root `webview` directory.

# Testing

From the root `webview` directory, run `./script/test` (which runs `npm test`).
npm test failures are not as informative as they could be.
If `coffeelint` fails, you can run it with `grunt coffeelint` to get more information

# Updating

From the root `webview` directory, run `./script/update`, which executes the following commands:
1. `npm update`
2. `bower update`
3. `grunt aloha --verbose`

# Hosting

### Quick Development Setup

1. Install [nginx](http://nginx.org/)
2. Run `./script/start` (uses `nginx.development.conf`)
3. (optional) Install https://github.com/prerender/prerender
4. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
5. Run `./script/stop` to stop nginx

### Customization Notes

1. Update settings in `src/scripts/settings.js` if necessary to, for example, include
the correct Google Analytics ID, and to point to wherever `cnxarchive` is being hosted.

2. Ensure resources are being served with the correct MIME type, including fonts.
  * Example nginx MIME types that may need to be added:

  ```nginx
    types {
        image/svg+xml           svg svgz;
        font/truetype           ttf;
        font/opentype           otf;
        application/font-woff   woff;
    }
  ```

3. Configure your server to point at `dist/index.html` (or `src/index.html` for development)
  * Unresolveable URIs should load `dist/index.html` or `src/index.html`
  * If not hosting the site from the domain root, update `root` in `src/scripts/settings.js`
  * `scripts`, `styles`, and `images` routes should be rewritten to the correct paths
